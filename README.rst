========================

Installation
============

On development systems:
-----------------------

1. Run ``git clone git@github.com:inyokaproject/theme-ubuntuusers.git`` next to the cloned inyoka-repository. (Basically, it doesn't matter were you clone the themes-repository, but for support reasons it might be better to use the same base folder like for inyoka.) After cloning the file-structure should look like: ::

        $ tree -L 1
        .
        ├── inyoka
        ├── theme-ubuntuusers
        └── maybe another-theme

2. Switch into the repository: ``cd theme-ubuntusers``
3. Install as a development package: ``python setup.py develop``
